House Price Prediction: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview
This project focuses on the initial data analysis of a house price dataset to gain insights and understand the key factors affecting house prices. The goal is to explore the dataset, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and derive useful observations.

Features Analyzed
-Numerical Features: Basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) of numerical columns such as house size, number of rooms, etc.
-Categorical Features: Frequency distribution of categorical variables such as location, type of house, etc.
-Correlation Analysis: Investigating relationships between numerical features to find strong correlations with house prices.
-Outlier Detection: Identifying and analyzing outliers in the dataset.
-Missing Data Analysis: Evaluating the extent and handling of missing data.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python
-Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
-NumPy: For numerical computations.
-Matplotlib: For data visualization and identifying trends and patterns.

Key Findings
-Initial patterns in the data suggest correlations between house prices and variables like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
-Certain features show higher variance, indicating potential for prediction enhancement through feature engineering.
-Missing data was handled through techniques such as imputation and removing rows/columns where necessary.
